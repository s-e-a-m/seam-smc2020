After decades of sound and music technology development, the everyday practice reveals one of the first walking dead: the stereophony. In less than a hundred years from its birth, the stereophony is not only at the end of its comprehension but also at the end of its necessity. The electroacoustic literature has constant focus, through history, to the listening. Listening as a starting point of thinking, as a background of composing, as a long-distance perspective. Nowdays we actually know better than Blumlein itself how people listen and how ears and brains do what they do. What we lose versus Blumlein, is the necessity of listening, of reproduction and of listening of reproduction.

When the words no longer point the meaning of themselves, we lose (with the meaning), also the reality we used to refer to. The transition from the age of mechanical reproduction of reality, through the history of attempts to reproduce it up to the virtual reality, must pass through, preserving and sustaining, that concepts which have defined the necessity of reproduction. Sustaining the electroacoustic literature, the repertoire, means to sustain the necessity of some concepts, like stereophony, and their related and consolidated practice, to the perspective of development or, at least, the surviving of comprehension.
